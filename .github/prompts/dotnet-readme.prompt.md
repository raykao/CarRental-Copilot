# C# DotNet Program Documentation Generator Prompt

Use this prompt template to create comprehensive README documentation for C# DotNet programs. Replace the placeholders in [brackets] with program-specific information.

Write the README documentation in the same directory as the C# DotNet code, in a file named `README.md`. If the file already exists, update the documentation with your new results.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Analyze the C# DotNet Program**: Before using this template, examine the source code to understand:
   - Program purpose and business logic
   - Input/output requirements
   - Data structures and processing flow
   - Error handling and validation
   - Key algorithms or calculations

2. **Gather Context Information**:
   - Business domain or application area
   - Target environment (Linux, Windows, MacOS etc.)
   - Related programs or dependencies
   - Historical or regulatory context

3. **Fill in the Template**:
   - Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with specific information
   - Remove sections that don't apply to your program
   - Add additional sections if needed for complex programs

4. **Create Sample Output**:
   - Run the program if possible to capture real output
   - Create realistic sample data and interactions
   - Show both successful execution and error scenarios

5. **Technical Details**:
   - Extract key C# DotNet language features used
   - Document important data structures from DATA DIVISION
   - Explain complex business logic from PROCEDURE DIVISION
   - Note any unusual or advanced techniques

## Customization Tips

- **For Batch Programs**: Focus more on file processing, record layouts, and batch control
- **For Interactive Programs**: Emphasize user interface, screen flows, and validation
- **For Utility Programs**: Document parameters, return codes, and integration points
- **For Legacy Programs**: Add historical context, migration considerations, and modernization notes
